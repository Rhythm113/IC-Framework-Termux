HI This is a Signature Killer from Github Runs on java

This tool only works for applications whose signatures are only verified by PackageManager.getPackageInfo().signatures .

Just RENAME your apk file to src.apk & Put to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/ or $HOME in non root mode then run start-kill output will be renamed as out.apk

if you want to edit configs run  "sign-config"

More Update will come soon stay tuned !
